      "Okay, so I need to figure out the most visited places in Delhi. I'm not super familiar with Delhi, but I know it's a big city with a lot of history. Let me start by thinking about what I know about Delhi. I remember hearing about the Red Fort and the Qutub Minar. Those are probably historical sites. Then there's India Gate, which I think is a war memorial. I've also heard of Chandni Chowk, which is a market area, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "I should consider different categories of places because people visit for different reasons. There are historical monuments, religious sites, markets, parks, and modern attractions. Let me break it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historical monuments: Red Fort, Qutub Minar, India Gate, Humayun's Tomb. I think those are all in Delhi. Maybe also Purana Qila, which is an old fort. Tughlaqabad Fort could be another one, though I'm not sure how popular it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Religious places: There's the Jama Masjid, which is a big mosque. Akshardham Temple is another one I've heard of; it's a large Hindu temple. Lotus Temple is famous too, it's a Bahá'í temple with a unique design. Then there's Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, a Sikh temple known for its community kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Markets and shopping areas: Chandni Chowk is a very old and busy market. Palika Bazaar is another market, I think it's underground. Sarojini Nagar is known for affordable clothes. Lajpat Nagar is also a market area, maybe more for clothes and street food. Connaught Place is a commercial area with shops and restaurants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parks and recreational spots: Lodi Gardens is a park where people go to relax and exercise. Nehru Park is another big park. The Ridge area in Delhi might be part of the Aravalli hills, offering some nature spots. Deer Park could be a place with, well, deer and a nice environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Modern attractions: The Delhi Eye, which is like a giant Ferris wheel. Select Citywalk is a mall in Saket, I think. DLF Mall of India in Noida is close to Delhi and very popular. Kingdom of Dreams is a entertainment place with shows and food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Museums and art: National Museum is the largest in India. Crafts Museum showcases traditional crafts. The Art Heritage Gallery has modern art. Kiran Nadar Museum is another art museum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other places: Hauz Khas Village is trendy with cafes and boutiques. Dilli Haat is a place where you can buy crafts and try regional foods. Jantar Mantar is an observatory with interesting instruments. Rashtrapati Bhavan is the President's house, and the Mughal Garden there is beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure I'm not missing any major spots. Maybe some temples or other historical sites. Wait, is the Parliament House in Delhi? Yes, but I'm not sure if it's a tourist spot. Maybe not as much as the others. Also, there's the Akshardham Temple which is very popular.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've covered most categories. Now, I should list them in order of popularity or visitor numbers, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers. Red Fort and Qutub Minar are definitely up there. India Gate is iconic. Chandni Chowk is a must for shopping. Akshardham and Jama Masjid are major religious sites.\n",
